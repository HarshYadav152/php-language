# PHP Programs

## Overview
This repository contains various PHP programs that I have learned and implemented. These programs cover different aspects of PHP, including basic syntax, file handling, database connections, and web development concepts(in future) aso some advance topics like superglobals.

## Prerequisites
Before running the PHP programs, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- PHP (latest stable version recommended) [Download php](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.4.4-Win32-vs17-x64.zip)
- A web server (Apache or Nginx)
- MySQL/MariaDB (if database-related programs are included)
- A browser to test web-based programs

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
2. Place the PHP files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP(in C: drive), `www` for WAMP, or `public_html` for a hosting server).
3. Start your web server and database server if applicable.

## Running the Programs
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/{program_name}.php`.
- If the program interacts with a database, ensure the database is set up correctly.
- Modify `config.php` or similar files if credentials are required.

## Contents
The repository includes programs on:
- Basic PHP syntax and variables
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and arrays
- File handling (reading/writing files)
- Form handling and validation
- Database connectivity using MySQLi/PDO
- Session management and authentication
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP

## Database Setup (If Required)
For programs that use a database:
1. Import the provided SQL file (if available) using phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI.
2. Update database credentials in the program files.
3. Ensure database services are running before executing the scripts.

## Troubleshooting
- Check PHP error logs for debugging.
- Ensure the correct PHP version is installed.
- Verify file permissions if running on a server.
